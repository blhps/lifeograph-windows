Description
===========

Lifeograph is an off-line and private journal and note taking application.
It offers a rich feature set presented in a clean and simple user interface.



Comparison to Linux Version
===========================

Lifeograph for Windows is currently in early development phase and lacks many
features provided by the Linux version. Main missing features are:

    * Chapter support
    * Favorite entries
    * Todo status for entries and chapters
    * Filtering
    * Printing
    * Check/bulleted/numbered lists in entries
    * Links of any kind in entries
    * Spell checking
    * Creating and editing themes (existing themes can be used)



Building from Source
====================

Lifeograph for Windows is developed in Orwell Dev-C++.
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)

Users interested in building from the source code are strongly recommended
to use this software.

Additionally, libgcrypt and libgpg-error dlls are needed to run
Lifeograph. Full names of these libraries are listed below:

	* libgcrypt-20.dll
	* libgpg-error-0.dll

These dlls can be obtained from MinGW, Cygwin or Gpg4win projects.



Installation & Running
======================

Lifeograph for Windows is completely portable and installation is not
required. Just put the following files into the same folder and run the exe.

    * lifeograph.exe
    * lifeo.conf
	* The two dll files in the section above (if they are not already somewhere
	  in the PATH)
